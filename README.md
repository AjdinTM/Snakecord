A simple and fun way to play **Snake** inside of **Discord**! This **Discord** bot was made with Repl.it, using Discord's **new** message components!

## Features
This bot has a lot of different features, including __automatic__ movement, points system and __backgrounds__!

## To-Do
- Use Repl.it's secrets feature for tokens.
- Finish the README.
- Done!

## Run the code yourself
**Repl.it:**
- Open the **Secrets** window on the left.
- Add the following secrets:
  - `production.stable` as the key, and your bot's token as the value.
  - `development.beta` as the key, and your bot's token as the value. (Only add this secret if you want a separate development bot.)
- Go to the **Shell**.
- Run `bash start.sh` to install __Node 15.3.0__ and to start the bot. (Run `bash beta.start.sh` if you want to start the beta bot.)
